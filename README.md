# Udacity MeMe App

I moved things around for usability. In Meme 1.0 I used one cmaera button with an Alert offering the option between camera and photo library (album) as memes are often taken spontanouesly capturing a moment. These "moments" don't always find us with two hands free, you may be holding a laptop, a sandwich, a coffee mug, etc. Enabling the user to handle everything with one hand has been the driving designing principle. Hence the idea to cluster all the necessary buttons at the bottom to be easily reachable with the thumb. I sacrificed one additional "tap" for better UI design: as I moved the share button at the bottom, I didn't want to clutter the application with three (3) buttons.

I replaced the suggested "TOP" and "BOTTOM" with the more prescritive "WRITE HERE" and went for an all-black look.
I designed a new app icon/logo in Figma (1024x1024) and https://appicon.co to generate the icon set
