# meme version 2
A project I worked on for Udacity's iOS nano degree

The app allows one to take a photo and place meme style text on the top and bottom of the picture. The picture can then be shared using the iOS share sheet, and once shared will be saved to an in memory database of memes. Note, that fully closing the app will erase any memes saved.
